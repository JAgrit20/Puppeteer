The Delhi Police today launched patrolling on bicycle to improve policing in congested localities in trans-Yamuna region of the city. The move is also being billed as a green initiative. The bicycle patrols will complement and supplement the existing motorcycle and PCR patrols which focus mainly on crime prevention along the arterial and main roads of Delhi, police said.

The bicycle patrol was flagged off by Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the Union minister of state for home affairs, in the presence of Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari and Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik. He flagged off the first batch of 65 bicycles allotted to the Eastern Range of Delhi Police that comprises three districts — east, northeast and Shahdara.
