The Delhi Police today launched patrolling on bicycle to improve policing in congested localities in trans-Yamuna region of the city. The move is also being billed as a green initiative. The bicycle patrols will complement and supplement the existing motorcycle and PCR patrols which focus mainly on crime prevention along the arterial and main roads of Delhi, police said.

The bicycle patrol was flagged off by Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the Union minister of state for home affairs, in the presence of Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari and Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik. He flagged off the first batch of 65 bicycles allotted to the Eastern Range of Delhi Police that comprises three districts — east, northeast and Shahdara.

IRCTC Uttarakhand tour package: Tour date, costs, itinerary and more details
IRCTC is offering an eight nights, nine days tour package to Uttarakhand that will cover Mussoorie, Corbett, Nainital and Ranikhet.

IRCTC is offering an eight nights, nine days tour package to Uttarakhand that will cover Mussoorie, Corbett, Nainital and Ranikhet. The state of Uttarakhand is also known as ‘Devbhumi’ (Land of Gods) because of the many pilgrimage sites nesting in its hills. Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabhar and the Terai. It borders Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north; Nepal to the east; Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west.

The IRCTC tour package ‘Hill stations of Uttarakhand’ (package code: SHR064) can be booked any time throughout the year. The tour begins on Tuesdays all around the year. The locations covered in the package include the most picturesque sights in the state. In Mussoorie, tourists can take a nature walk across ‘Camel’s Back Road’. This road takes its name from a rocky outcrop in the shape of a camel’s hump. There is also ‘Gun Hill’ where a cannon was used to sound out midday for many years, and Happy Valley that has a small Tibetan Temple. Jim Corbett National Park is the oldest national park in India, named after the hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett who played a key role in its establishment, which was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park.

Nainital is set in a valley containing a mango-shaped lake, approximately two miles in circumference, and surrounded by mountains, Naina on the north, Deopatha on the west, and Ayarpatha on the south. Ranikhet is a hill station which means Queen’s Meadow (in Hindi), gets its name from a local legend that Raja Sudhardev won the heart of his queen, Rani Padmini, who subsequently chose the area for her residence, giving it the name, Ranikhet, though no palace exists in the area. It was previously under the Nepalese Rule, and the Kumaonese (people of Kumaon Region) won it under the leadership of their able General Kashi Nath Adhikari – after whom the small town of Kashipur was named (which at one point of time was the gateway to the hills and is now an educational/institutional hub) – with the help of Britishers at around 1816 and is a part of India now.

Set 6500 ft above sea level, the Ningwu Cave is about 280 ft deep and the walls and floors of this cave are thickly coated with icicles, starting from ceiling to floor. People believe that the cave was formed during the Ice Age era, and that’s why locals also call it 10000-Year Cave. To make it an experience of a lifetime for visitors, the management has put hundreds of colourful light bulbs that beautifully illuminate the icy walls.

The science behind the phenomenon

The biggest question is as to why the ice never melts in the cave even during the peak summers. As per the scientists studying ice caves, the prime reason is the structure and shape of the cave here, which is like a bowling pin (curve). Given the cave’s curvy ‘figure’, cold air remains trapped inside, which ultimately keeps it cool and frozen throughout the year. These ‘cold traps’ are the reason behind the frozen cave of China.


Where else can these ice caves be found?

Such ice caves can be found across Europe, Central Asia, and North America. There are various similar caves, though winter lasts the whole year at all these places. Most of these ice caves are set in Alaska, Iceland and Russia, which are generally cooler and frozen regions.

IRCTC is offering an eight nights, nine days tour package to Uttarakhand that will cover Mussoorie, Corbett, Nainital and Ranikhet. The state of Uttarakhand is also known as ‘Devbhumi’ (Land of Gods) because of the many pilgrimage sites nesting in its hills. Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabhar and the Terai. It borders Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north; Nepal to the east; Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west.

The IRCTC tour package ‘Hill stations of Uttarakhand’ (package code: SHR064) can be booked any time throughout the year. The tour begins on Tuesdays all around the year. The locations covered in the package include the most picturesque sights in the state. In Mussoorie, tourists can take a nature walk across ‘Camel’s Back Road’. This road takes its name from a rocky outcrop in the shape of a camel’s hump. There is also ‘Gun Hill’ where a cannon was used to sound out midday for many years, and Happy Valley that has a small Tibetan Temple. Jim Corbett National Park is the oldest national park in India, named after the hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett who played a key role in its establishment, which was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park.

Nainital is set in a valley containing a mango-shaped lake, approximately two miles in circumference, and surrounded by mountains, Naina on the north, Deopatha on the west, and Ayarpatha on the south. Ranikhet is a hill station which means Queen’s Meadow (in Hindi), gets its name from a local legend that Raja Sudhardev won the heart of his queen, Rani Padmini, who subsequently chose the area for her residence, giving it the name, Ranikhet, though no palace exists in the area. It was previously under the Nepalese Rule, and the Kumaonese (people of Kumaon Region) won it under the leadership of their able General Kashi Nath Adhikari – after whom the small town of Kashipur was named (which at one point of time was the gateway to the hills and is now an educational/institutional hub) – with the help of Britishers at around 1816 and is a part of India now.

International Finance Corporation (IFC) to invest $2.5 million in Pakistan’s leading VC Sarmayacar

International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group will invest $2.5 million in Sarmayar, Pakistan’s leading VC fund for early-stage startups in the country, the organization announced today, in a statement. Led by Rabeel Warriach and Dr. Bernhard Klemen, Sarmayacar had officially launched last year with $30 million as first closing of their fund and has invested in multiple Pakistani startups since then.

IFC’s investment is comprised of $2 million in equity commitments from Startup Catalyst, IFC’s global program that backs accelerators and seed funds in emerging markets and $500,000 from Women Entrepreneurship Initiative (We-Fi), a partnership among governments, multilateral development banks, and other public and private sector stakeholders, hosted by the World Bank Group.

Rabeel Warraich, founder of Sarmayacar, in a statement, said, “Pakistan offers a unique opportunity with its improving stability, large, young population, rising middle class, fast-growing internet and smartphone penetration, and a dearth of venture capital in the ecosystem. Our goal at Sarmayacar is to provide value-add early-stage funding to entrepreneurs who are building scalable, market-transforming consumer and enterprise technology businesses in Pakistan.”

“This marks the first such investment from the World Bank Group in Pakistan and will enable us to back more startups in the country, while also providing access to a global network, new markets and domain expertise to our portfolio companies,” he added.

Issa Aghabi who leads IFC’s VC investments in MENA & Pakistan had told MENAbytes earlier this year that they’re looking to make both direct and indirect investments in Pakistan to support the local ecosystem there.

The statement by IFC noted that there is an emerging vibrant ecosystem for startups in Pakistan, “IFC’s entry into venture financing in the country is expected to catalyze follow-on funding from existing and external limited partners.”

Nadeem Siddiqui, IFC’s Senior Manager for Pakistan and Afghanistan, commenting on the occasion, said, “The early stage of local venture capital ecosystems is often the most crucial building block for sustaining healthy entrepreneurship and innovation, which helps to drive economic growth and create quality jobs. Our aim is to support these entrepreneurs by helping to bridge issues around insufficient seed capital and strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Pakistan.”

IFC also said that its investment in Sarmayacar will increase the competitiveness of the venture capital market and boost country’s entrepreneurship ecosystem. The investment is also expected to improve investee growth by helping startups raise their product offerings, increase headcount, and expand into new markets.

Even though Sarmayacar had officially launched last year, they’ve been investing in Pakistani startups for over two year with a local Spotify-like music streaming service Patari being one of their first investments. Sarmayacar’s most recent investments include a motorbike-based ride-hailing startup Bykea and a Karachi-based edtech Dot and Line.

If you ever wished to live your Frozen dream, you might want to check out the famous Ningwu Cave. It is set in the gorgeous mountains of the Shanxi Province in China. It seems that the cave still lives in the age it was born in, the Ice Age, some 3 million years ago. as the ice here never melts, not even during hot and sultry summer days.

Set 6500 ft above sea level, the Ningwu Cave is about 280 ft deep and the walls and floors of this cave are thickly coated with icicles, starting from ceiling to floor.

Synopsis

If you are planning to visit this country, get acquainted with a unique thing called the Big Rock Guatape, which is a massive rock as high as 2,135 m above the sea level.


Colombia is one of those affordable destinations for Indians. So, if you are planning to visit this country, get acquainted with a unique thing called the Big Rock Guatape, which is a massive rock as high as 2,135 m above the sea level. Visitors get mesmerised by the breathtaking views of the surrounding valley once they manage to reach the top of the rock.

A worshipful rock
The Rock of Guatape has a noticeable crevice which has been turned into an attractive stairway for the visitors. For those who think what led to the formation of this crevice, it was because the rock was naturally lifted up while the Cordillera Occidental mountain range was being formed. Of course, this process took many, many years if the timeline of the rock formation is concerned. It is said that the former inhabitants of the region considered this rock to be sacred. And now since it has turned into a tourist site,you will be surprised to find food and souvenir vendors at the summit.
How to reach?
No wonder this giant rock is one of the major tourist attractions in Colombia, and it can be reached by a bus ride from Medellin in Colombia. It is located near the border of towns Guatapé and El Peñol, and interestingly, both of them claim that this rock is located within their territory.
Just be sure to prepare your body and mind in advance to climb as many as 740 steps to reach the rock summit. If you are up for this adventure, add a trip to Rock of Guatape to your itinerary.

Odisha finally managed to secure a geographical indication (GI) tag for its beloved local version of rasgulla. It now seems that the tug of war between West Bengal and Kolkata has resulted in a draw, with Odisha also being granted the GI tag for Odisha Rasagola, i.e., less than two years after West Bengal won the GI tag for its rasagola. The formal certification was issued by Chennai-based GI registry on its website.

A GI refers to a name or distinctive sign that is used on a product i.e., usually owned collectively, and can be used to distinguish goods on the basis of its geographical origin and unique characteristics. Also, the GI tag helps in marketing and branding of a local product, and can draw penalties if someone is found copying outside that geographical region.

In 2017, West Bengal received GI tag for its variety of rasgulla, which lead to many people believing that the sweet delicacy originated in West Bengal. This led to a fight between the two states both on social media and off it too. However, now Odisha Rasagola getting the GI tag seems to end the two-year-long battle.


The GI tag for the same product from both the states will now be recognised by two distinct texture and taste. While submitting the same before the GI registrar, the Odisha Small Industries Corp. Ltd, which received the GI tag, said “Odisha rasgulla is very soft to feel, juicy and non-chewy in consistency, and can be swallowed without teeth pressure. The rasgulla prepared in other places is circular in shape, milk white in colour and basically spongy and chewy in consistency.""

While West Bengal claimed that the idea of this delicacy was conceived by Nobin Chandra Das (birth 1845) at his Bagbazar residence in Kolkata, Odisha locals cite that their rasagola dates back to the 12th century when these were being offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple.

“In the last two decades, the population of ponies has declined,” said Chandra Gomangi, livestock coordinator working with Parivartan, a local non-profit in Chitrakonda. Instances of ponies choking after ingesting plastic while foraging for food in garbage dumps have been reported. Recently, new road networks have been constructed to provide better connectivity to people living in remote habitations. Penetration of motorised vehicles and public transport facilities in the area have reduced the demand for ponies. Younger generations are also not interested in rearing ponies and often fail to provide proper care and attention, Gomangi said. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

Karan Veer Singh, principal scientist and Mahesh Hedgav, scientist at National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), conducted a survey in April this year to document breed characteristics and collected blood sample from local ponies in Dudhapali and Luchapani village at Papermetla Panchayat. “This is a unique breed. We are trying to register this breed with the NBAGR,” said Hedgav, adding that such a move will boost urgent conservation interventions. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

“We have to preserve and propagate this rare natural heritage,” said Kalyanapu, the livestock expert, adding that the ponies are so vulnerable that even an epidemic could wipe out the current population. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

The Chitrakonda block in southern Odisha’s Malkangiri district is home to a non-descript pony breed which can undertake long journeys at high altitudes. For years, tribal communities such as the Gadaba, Kondh, Kotia, Kondadora and Paroja have been rearing this breed as pack carriers. There is no official count of the exact population of these animals. However, according to a recent survey conducted by WASSAN, a non-profit, there are 461 domesticated horses spread across 40 villages in Ralegada, Dhuliput and Papermetla and other Panchayats in Swabhiman Anchal areas.

“These ponies are of medium size and stand five feet high approximately,” said Udaya Kumar Kalyanapu, a livestock expert working with WASSAN in Malkangiri. Colour morphism is common in this breed. Therefore, they can be of different colours including chestnut, black bay, white bay and white roan. The average oestrous and gestation period is 22 and 340 days respectively. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

Their temperament is docile and friendly. They are intelligent but can be stubborn sometimes. They can carry loads of around 100 kilograms. Local people say they are agile and can withstand food scarcity, drought and other extreme geo-climatic conditions. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

Glimpses of a fading culture in Uttarakhand’s mountains
As glaciers shrink and streams dry up, Bhutia communities are struggling to keep their cultural heritage alive in the Indian Himalayas

Shikha Tripathi

August 31, 2022

At 2,200 metres above sea level in the Indian Himalayas, in a small museum overlooked by snow-capped peaks, the essence of a community’s metamorphosis is locked behind glass displays.

Objects preserve snatches of past generations of the Bhutia community: pieces of clothing, jewellery, household items, faded photos, and maps, curling at the edges.

Once the guardians of the Indo-Tibet trade route, the Bhutia used to be one of the more prosperous high-altitude communities of Kumaon, the eastern region of what is now the Indian state of Uttarakhand, which adjoins Nepal. Over the past 60 years, their way of life has changed dramatically. Trade routes closed after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and in search of livelihood opportunities, Uttarakhand’s Bhutia community relocated from the Johar Valley in the high mountains to the towns of the Himalayan foothills.

Today, rather than trade and commerce, they make a living from livestock, agriculture and handicrafts.

Who are the Bhutia?

The word ‘Bhutia’ refers to a group of people who migrated south from Tibet around the 9th century AD, settling in the mountain ranges along the Indo-Tibet border.

Many have retained aspects of Tibetan culture while adopting elements of Hindu culture.

Today, it is estimated there are more than a million Bhutia, about 200,000 of whom are in India.

One of the foothill towns they moved to is Munsyari. It was here, in 2000, that local historian Sher Singh Pangtey established the Tribal Heritage Museum. Inside, rows of black and white photographs are interspersed with coloured prints from the 1980s. The images depict scenes of village life in parts of Johar Valley that are now being abandoned, capturing the memory and melancholy of a time that has long passed. 

Photographs in the Tribal Heritage Museum in Munsyari, mostly from the 1950s to the 1980s, offer snapshots into a way of life that is fast declining. Local historian Sher Singh Pangtey dedicated a lifetime of effort to preserving Bhutia culture at the museum, up until his death in 2017. (Image: Shikha Tripathi / The Third Pole)

No Bhutia households live in the Johar Valley permanently now; only the army and road workers remain year-round. Around 20 families continue to divide their year between the Johar Valley and Munsyari. Simply known as ‘migration’, many complete the annual process of returning to their native land at the beginning of May and descending every winter as a way to hold on to their farming lands, slowly dilapidating ancestral homes and a sense of belonging. 

It is a journey of about 50 kilometres, rising 1,220 metres in altitude, between Munsyari and Milam – the highest village in the Johar Valley that is still inhabited. Men and women, including the elderly for as long as they are able, continue this gruelling journey on precarious terrain, navigating narrow paths at the edge of precipices, through rockfalls and rain; wading across streams that sweep away old paths and create new routes nearly every season; and passing through valleys of awe-inspiring vastness and unmatched beauty.

The changing climate in the high Himalayas, however, has made this journey harder and more unpredictable. By 2012, the average annual temperature in Pithoragarh, the district where Munsyari lies, was 0.58 degrees Celsius higher than it was in 1911 – a bigger increase than any other district in the state. Rainfall has become more erratic.

“Earlier, we could plan and prepare better for migration. Now it rains when we least expect it, making the journey that much tougher to make with all our rations and supplies,” says Pushpa Laspal, who sells food to travellers and road workers out of her kitchen in Mapang village to make up for lost income from trade and agriculture.

This year, for example, unexpected early rainfall delayed people’s journeys to the end of May and early June. Climatic changes like this add to the strains on the Bhutia, driving the loss of traditional culture in Johar. 

One of the most prominent examples of this is the majestic Milam glacier – the main source of water for inhabitants of the valley. For decades, scaling the glacier has been the ultimate prize of trekkers seeking to conquer a tough route. Old photographs of trekking routes show an abundance of streams and water bodies, and elderly residents tell The Third Pole that the glacier used to reach “just past” Milam village.

Now, the snout of the glacier has receded to 8 kilometres upstream of the village. Between 1954 and 2006, the Milam glacier retreated by 25 metres a year on average: fast enough to make an alarming difference down the line.

Today, as the water supply moves further from the village, farming and daily life in Milam is becoming increasingly difficult. 

Traditional water mills called gharats were once common across the mountains of the Himalayas, used to grind grain. Rising temperatures and reduced water flow in many rivers and streams has made gharats a thing of the past. Occasionally, abandoned mills can be spotted by what little is left of once-powerful watercourses.

Bhutia culture fading fast

For more than a decade, work has been underway to build a road connecting Milam to Munsyari, currently due to be complete by 2027. By then, it is likely that much more will have faded from Bhutia culture than the hike to reach the higher altitudes. 

From food habits to clothing, and from livelihoods to daily routines, change has crept almost unnoticed into the lives of the Shauka community, as Bhutias in Kumaon are known locally. 

Butter tea, previously a year-round Johar staple, is primarily a winter drink now because of its warming properties – or served as a beverage to curious visitors trying it for the first time. A compact, modern butter churner used to make the drink has taken the place of the traditional dumka, a huge wooden container that now lies neglected in most kitchen corners. The former is easy to carry and more convenient for making smaller quantities of tea.

Dumcha, a traditional chutney made from a mix of several heat-inducing herbs, is consumed mainly in upper Johar today. For those who have moved to lower altitudes, where temperatures are more forgiving, the concoction has lost its appeal. Popular herbs like gandrayani and jumbu that need colder temperatures to grow could once be cultivated at lower elevations. Now, shopkeepers in Munsyari say they have to be grown at higher altitudes, then dried and transported, resulting in the cost shooting up tenfold. 

Previously, a wide variety of crops was cultivated in the Johar Valley. Now only potato farming persists, which requires much less water, older people across the valley told The Third Pole.

In a corner of the Tribal Heritage Museum of Munsyari hangs an anwal coat, a thick, double-woven shepherding coat worn by locals for protection from the cold and rain. Previously popular due to its warmth and water-resistance, it is used by few now, the display information in the museum observes.

Before 1962, the Bhutia in Kumaon would weave with yak wool and pashmina, trading other goods for goats from Tibet. But, like the anwal coat, the thick komaul and odre (traditional long dresses made from wool) have fallen out of fashion, and have been replaced by cotton sweatshirts. Now, most clothes made in the region are kurtas (long cotton shirt) and angora wool caps to be sold to tourists. 

Damyanti Pangti, a weaver in Darkot, a village in Munsyari sub-district, reminisces about her father-in-law who only ever wore handmade clothes made by his wife. Pangti, who was taught to weave on a traditional loom called a khaddi by her mother-in-law, says yak wool is too warm to be worn in today’s warmer temperatures, not to mention expensive.

Will she pass on her weaving knowledge to her daughter, who is studying medicine in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh? She’s doubtful: it is the older generation who are trying to straddle the old world and the new, desperate to hold on to remnants of their culture.

Nevertheless, Pangti tells The Third Pole that she feels fortunate to have learned this traditional craft. She has been able to adapt the technique to lamb and angora wool, which are much softer on the skin and more popular with tourists. In this way, she has been able to make a living. 

Recently, women in Munsyari tell The Third Pole, their women-led cooperative has noticed a renewed interest in traditional clothing. The cooperative, called Saras, was founded in 2008 and works with about 50 women around Munsyari. There have been a few bulk orders for coats made from traditional yak and pashmina wool – and not just the angora wool products they make to suit modern preferences. These usually come from Him Kutir, an NGO, which sells them in city shops or at exhibitions.

What does the future hold for the next Bhutia generation?

Further changes have arrived as the next generation of Bhutia search for livelihood opportunities. With the treacherous higher altitudes increasingly free of snow earlier in the year, young people now embark on a new, risk-laden path altitudes to collect yarsagumba, the prized caterpillar fungus used in traditional medicine. 

RECOMMENDED

Longer warm spells with earlier snowmelt and later snowfall have increased the foraging window for the fungus, which is near impossible to detect when buried under snow. But one wrong step in this environment could mean a fatal fall: narrow paths are flanked by sheer drops; routes are dotted with crevasses; breathing problems are common in the thin air; and conflict between groups over territory is not unheard of.

The wait for the snow to melt during springtime used to be much longer years ago. Just a few more warm weeks mean much more fungus can be collected. However, longer picking seasons have exacerbated the impact on ecologically sensitive zones, by opening up routes to areas that were once perpetually snowbound, locals and people involved in the trade told The Third Pole.

On a hot summer afternoon in the market near the Tribal Heritage Museum in Munsyari, a group of teenagers are buying ice lollies at a local store. They discuss an upcoming litter pick in Munsyari organised by the local youth club, with the aim of raising broader awareness about environmental issues and climate change. 

The teenagers voice their vision for a modern, environmentally conscious future in which sustainable tourism becomes the norm – with proper waste management, sensitive development, wildlife tours and homestays. It is through such livelihoods opportunities that they want to forge a new path for the community. 

Somewhere in between these shifting worlds runs the hope that the old and the new shall find a middle ground, and the heritage of the Bhutias of Kumaon will not be lost for good.

India: PLFI Rankling Irritant In Jharkhand – Analysis
 August 31, 2022  SATP  0 Comments

By SATP

By Deepak Kumar Nayak*

On August 18, 2022, Police arrested Badal Oraon, a cadre of the People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI), a splinter group of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), from Badchorgai under Bagdu Police Station limits in Lohardaga District. Police recovered several items, including a country-made revolver, from his possession. Lohardaga Superintendent of Police (SP), R. Ramkumar disclosed that, on August 4, a First Information Report (FIR) related to ‘levy’ (extortion) collection was registered at Bagdu Police Station and, taking action in the case, Sunil Munda and Bajrang Lohra were arrested on August 7. Based on information provided by them, a search operation was launched and Badal Oraon, a resident of Jogna under the Senha Police Station area, was arrested. 

Elsewhere, on the same day (August 18), Police arrested Topal Munda aka Topal Chutia Purti (25), a PLFI cadre, from near the Lakshmi Narayan High School ground on the Murhu-Sarvada Road under the Murhu Block (administrative unit) in Khunti District. Topal, a resident of Karudih village under the Murhu Police Station, was actively working with PLFI 2020. Half a dozen cases have been registered against him in Murhu, Khunti and Bandgaon Police Stations, under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).  

On August 7, 2022, Police arrested two PLFI cadres, identified as Sunil Munda and Bajrang Lohra, from Jogiara village under Bagdu Police Station limits in Lohardaga District, for obstructing development construction work and demanding ‘levy’. Sunil and Bajrang have admitted to working for the PLFI under the leadership of its ‘commander’, Krishna Yadav. The items recovered from the arrested duo included, three country-made guns, banners and posters of PLFI, etc. 

On August 4, 2022, the Police raided the house of Prakash Lakra aka Prakash Oraon (32), a PLFI cadre, and arrested him from his residence in Ukdimadi Bardhakatoli under Torpa Police Station limits in Ranchi District. Police recovered a country-made revolver, a live bullet and PLFI pamphlets from him. 

On August 1, 2022, an ‘area commander’ of PLFI, identified as Badal Lohra, was arrested from the Tupudana area in Ranchi District. More than a dozen cases of attempted murder, robbery, and ‘levy’ extortion were registered against Lohra. He was mainly active in Basia in Simdega District, and Kamdara and Palkot in Gumla District. 

According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 38 PLFI cadres have been arrested since the beginning of the current year (data till August 21, 2022). During the corresponding period of 2021 as well, 38 PLFI cadres were arrested. Another 13 PLFI cadres were arrested in the remaining period of 2021, taking the total to 51 through 2021. Since the formation of the PLFI in July 2007, at least 714 PLFI cadres have been arrested. 

Mounting SF pressure has also resulted in the surrender of 32 PLFI cadres since July 2007, though not a single surrender has been reported in 2022. The last surrender was reported on March 11, 2018. 

Meanwhile, in the campaign against PLFI, Security Forces (SFs) have killed one PLFI cadre in the current year (data till August 21, 2022), as also during the corresponding period in 2021. In the remaining period of 2021, SFs killed another one cadre, taking the total to two, through 2021. A total of 102 PLFI cadres have been killed since the formation of the group in 2007. 

On the other hand, the last SF killing caried out by the PLFI took place on April 8, 2017, when a Sub-Inspector of Police and a constable were killed in a gunfight in Simdega District. Since its formation, PLFI has been responsible for seven SF fatalities. 

The last PLFI-linked civilian killing was reported on September 4, 2020, when PLFI cadres shot dead Nungu Barjo (30) at Khanda village under Bandgaon Police Station limits in the West Singhbhum District of Jharkhand. A total of 111 civilians have been killed by the PLFI, since its formation in 2007. 

Other parameters indicate that the outfit’s operational capacities in the State have suffered during the last few years due to SF successes on the ground. Indeed, no major incidents (resulting in three or more fatalities) involving the PLFI has been reported in 2022, as well as in 2021. The last such incident was on May 28, 2020, when three PLFI cadres, including a woman, were killed while another was injured in an exchange of fire with SFs in the Tabo Valley of the Manmandubera Forest under Tabo Police Station limits, in West Singhbhum District. Further, no incident of explosion has been carried out by the outfit in 2022, as, indeed, in the preceding five years. The last such incident was reported way back on October 16, 2016, when suspected PLFI cadres blew up two concrete sleepers on railway tracks by detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) between Khelari and McCluskieganj stations in Ranchi District.  

Though PLFI has been in a sustained decline over the past years, and has failed to carry out any major act of violence, its petty criminal and disruptive activities persist, as borne out by recent incidents.

According to an August 2022 report, PLFI is running a campaign for new recruitment, and is also forcing youth to join at gunpoint.

An August 6, 2022, report indicated that PLFI was giving arms to village youths to carry out the organisation’s subversive activities. This matter came to light during the interrogation of PLFI cadre Prakash Lakra, who was arrested by the Police on August 4, 2022. Prakash told the Police, inter alia, that PLFI had given a country-made revolvers, bullets and pamphlets to Bhikha Oraon in Lakra’s own village, and he was asked to expand the organization by involving other youth. 

Another report on May 21, 2022, revealed that PLFI cadres had issued a ‘decree’ in Namkum, Ranchi District, sending a letter to Rajan Tirkey, a young man, to give two AK 47 rifles or INR 2 million for the expansion of the organization. They threatened to kill him if he failed to meet the ‘levy’ demand. Tirkey, who lives in Rampur under the Namkum Police Station area, received the extortion demand through pamphlets and WhatsApp messages – which read “give extortion of 20 lakh rupees [INR 2 million]. If you cannot give money, then arrange 2 AK-47 rifles”. 

Further, a January 16, 2022, report, revealed that a Bangladeshi woman infiltrator identified as Anjali Patel aka Kaneez Fatima, who was arrested by Jharkhand Police in Delhi, was involved in supplying money and weapons to PLFI. According to an unnamed officer of the Ranchi Police, in Delhi Fatima met Nivesh Kumar, a Naxalite [Left Wing Extremist, LWE] who hails from Bihar and was living in Ranchi, and started working as a close associate with him, supplying arms to PLFI. An amount of INR 7.1 million and two expensive four-wheelers were seized from Fatima. 

PLFI is among the 19 LWE groups operating in Jharkhand, prominently including the CPI-Maoist, as well as other significant splinter groups of the CPI-Maoists including the Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), Jharkhand Jan Mukti Parishad (JJMP), Jharkhand Sangharsh Jan Mukti Morcha (JSJMM), and Jharkhand Prastuti Committee (JPC). PLFI is among the largest CPI-Maoist splinter groups in the state, but operates as more of an organized crime gang than an ‘ideologically driven’ movement. Its activities primarily focus on ‘levy’ (extortion) extraction.

 According to an August 18, 2022, report, SFs are preparing themselves for a decisive confrontation with PLFI, targeting the remaining militants in the group. Three years ago, there were 32 PLFI militants with rewards on their heads; their number is now down to just eight. These eight include PLFI ‘chief’ Dinesh Gope, with a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; ‘regional commander’ Martin Kerketta, INR 1.5 million; ‘zonal commanders’, Tilakeshwar Gope and Arif Ji aka Shashikant, INR 1 million each; ‘area commanders’, Balram Lohra aka Jatu aka Majnu, and Novel Sandi Purti, INR 200,000 each; two Local Guerilla Squad (LGS) members, Sukhram Gudiya aka Rode aka Gadwa and Samuel Budh aka Samu, INR 100,000 each.

PLFI has been considerably weakened, but remains a concern, particularly in view of its criminal activities, as well as its efforts to regain lost ground. Despite its decimation, as long as the remaining leadership element are able to evade the SFs, the group will continue to be a nuisance in the state.

“In the last two decades, the population of ponies has declined,” said Chandra Gomangi, livestock coordinator working with Parivartan, a local non-profit in Chitrakonda. Instances of ponies choking after ingesting plastic while foraging for food in garbage dumps have been reported. Recently, new road networks have been constructed to provide better connectivity to people living in remote habitations. Penetration of motorised vehicles and public transport facilities in the area have reduced the demand for ponies. Younger generations are also not interested in rearing ponies and often fail to provide proper care and attention, Gomangi said. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

Karan Veer Singh, principal scientist and Mahesh Hedgav, scientist at National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), conducted a survey in April this year to document breed characteristics and collected blood sample from local ponies in Dudhapali and Luchapani village at Papermetla Panchayat. “This is a unique breed. We are trying to register this breed with the NBAGR,” said Hedgav, adding that such a move will boost urgent conservation interventions. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

“We have to preserve and propagate this rare natural heritage,” said Kalyanapu, the livestock expert, adding that the ponies are so vulnerable that even an epidemic could wipe out the current population. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

The Chitrakonda block in southern Odisha’s Malkangiri district is home to a non-descript pony breed which can undertake long journeys at high altitudes. For years, tribal communities such as the Gadaba, Kondh, Kotia, Kondadora and Paroja have been rearing this breed as pack carriers. There is no official count of the exact population of these animals. However, according to a recent survey conducted by WASSAN, a non-profit, there are 461 domesticated horses spread across 40 villages in Ralegada, Dhuliput and Papermetla and other Panchayats in Swabhiman Anchal areas.

“These ponies are of medium size and stand five feet high approximately,” said Udaya Kumar Kalyanapu, a livestock expert working with WASSAN in Malkangiri. Colour morphism is common in this breed. Therefore, they can be of different colours including chestnut, black bay, white bay and white roan. The average oestrous and gestation period is 22 and 340 days respectively. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

Their temperament is docile and friendly. They are intelligent but can be stubborn sometimes. They can carry loads of around 100 kilograms. Local people say they are agile and can withstand food scarcity, drought and other extreme geo-climatic conditions. Photo: Abhijit Mohanty

COOPERATE: Regenstrief and VA Research Scientists addressing health disparity at the patient level
 
 
One of first studies focused on empowering Black veterans who have chronic back and other musculoskeletal pain

Black patients have historically faced disparities in pain treatment, reporting less effective and unequal pain care compared to White patients. Consequences of suboptimal care can be especially devastating for Black patients, who have been found to have more severe pain and worse pain-related outcomes.

To help Black veterans receive the chronic pain care they need, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Regenstrief Institute Research Scientists Marianne S. Matthias, PhD; Johanne Eliacin, PhD; and Matthew J. Bair, M.D., are testing COOPERATE (Communication and Activation in Pain to Enhance Relationships and Treat Pain with Equity), one of the first studies focused on equipping Black veterans who have chronic pain with tools to facilitate autonomy and control over their own care.

Research has shown that Black patients, relative to White patients, tend to have lower levels of patient activation (that is, having the knowledge, skills and confidence to manage one’s health). Lower patient activation is associated with negative health outcomes, including depression and anxiety, as well as with poorer physical health. Black patients also report experiencing poorer communication with clinicians, which, combined with lower levels of patient activation, may lead to hesitancy in seeking information, expressing concerns and asking questions about their health, according to Dr. Matthias, a health communication specialist and lead author of the paper presenting COOPERATE’s study design and methods.

In the innovative COOPERATE randomized clinical trial,125 Black veterans received a series of six individual coaching sessions delivered over 12 weeks. COOPERATE fosters patient activation by helping veterans clarify and prioritize their pain management goals and equipping them with communication skills, such as agenda setting and asking questions. These skills are important tools to help patients exercise autonomy and control over their own health. This is especially relevant for chronic musculoskeletal pain including lower back pain, one of the most common reasons individuals seek medical care, because active self-management is key for optimal pain management.

COOPERATE co-investigator Dr. Eliacin, who studies health disparities, notes that while causes of this inequity are complex, ineffective communication is a pervasive barrier to high-quality care, particularly for Black patients, leading to less satisfaction with care. In contrast, she says, productive communication is linked to patient satisfaction, adherence to medical instructions and positive clinical outcomes.

“Black patients with chronic pain have greater pain severity, often interfering with family life, recreational activities including exercise, work effectiveness, sleep, sex life and general mood,” said Dr. Bair, an internist who specializes in treating pain, who is the senior author of the design and methods paper. “Although this is less an issue in the VA, they typically receive lower levels of care for their pain.”

To mitigate pain care disparities, COOPERATE provides coaching that focuses on activating patients to define their personal goals – for example, being able to play with their grandchildren or being able to return to work – and then being able to articulate these goals to providers so patient and provider together can determine how best to manage pain and optimize function.

“It is important to point out that health inequity does not occur because of something patients are doing ‘wrong’,” said Dr. Matthias. “Rather, these inequities are baked into our society, including our healthcare system. Although COOPERATE does not address disparities at the system level, by focusing on the individual, COOPERATE helps patients acquire the tools needed to advocate for themselves in healthcare settings and enable their voices to be heard. Although larger, system-level interventions are still needed, equipping individuals with skills such as this is an important ingredient in optimizing pain care and reducing existing disparities.”

“Many Black patients often leave their healthcare visits feeling unheard by their providers or that the visit was unproductive,” said Dr. Eliacin. “Using self-management tools and coaching methods, COOPERATE is helping patients exercise greater control over their health and receive the care they need.”

“Communication and Activation in Pain to Enhance Relationships and Treat Pain with Equity (COOPERATE): Rationale, study design, methods, and sample characteristics,” is published in the peer reviewed Contemporary Clinical Trials.

Authors of the study, in addition to Drs. Matthias, Eliacin and Bair, are Adam Hirsh, PhD, Philip Procento, Kevin L. Rand, PhD, Michelle P. Salyers, PhD, and Mackenzie L. Shanahan, all of the IUPUI School of Science; Jasma Adams, MPH, Perla Flores, B.S., Tetla Menen, Diana J Burgess, PhD, all of the VA Medical Center Minneapolis and University of Minnesota; Joanne Daggy, PhD, and Anthony J. Perkins, M.S., both of the IU School of Medicine; and Laura J. Myers, PhD, VA Medical Center Indianapolis, Regenstrief Institute and IU School of Medicine. Dr. Salyers also is a former Regenstrief research scientist and a current Regenstrief affiliate scientist.

This work was supported by a Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Merit Review Award to Dr. Matthias (IIR 17-032).

India: PLFI Rankling Irritant In Jharkhand – Analysis
 August 31, 2022  SATP  0 Comments

By SATP

By Deepak Kumar Nayak*

On August 18, 2022, Police arrested Badal Oraon, a cadre of the People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI), a splinter group of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), from Badchorgai under Bagdu Police Station limits in Lohardaga District. Police recovered several items, including a country-made revolver, from his possession. Lohardaga Superintendent of Police (SP), R. Ramkumar disclosed that, on August 4, a First Information Report (FIR) related to ‘levy’ (extortion) collection was registered at Bagdu Police Station and, taking action in the case, Sunil Munda and Bajrang Lohra were arrested on August 7. Based on information provided by them, a search operation was launched and Badal Oraon, a resident of Jogna under the Senha Police Station area, was arrested. 

Elsewhere, on the same day (August 18), Police arrested Topal Munda aka Topal Chutia Purti (25), a PLFI cadre, from near the Lakshmi Narayan High School ground on the Murhu-Sarvada Road under the Murhu Block (administrative unit) in Khunti District. Topal, a resident of Karudih village under the Murhu Police Station, was actively working with PLFI 2020. Half a dozen cases have been registered against him in Murhu, Khunti and Bandgaon Police Stations, under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).  

On August 7, 2022, Police arrested two PLFI cadres, identified as Sunil Munda and Bajrang Lohra, from Jogiara village under Bagdu Police Station limits in Lohardaga District, for obstructing development construction work and demanding ‘levy’. Sunil and Bajrang have admitted to working for the PLFI under the leadership of its ‘commander’, Krishna Yadav. The items recovered from the arrested duo included, three country-made guns, banners and posters of PLFI, etc. 

On August 4, 2022, the Police raided the house of Prakash Lakra aka Prakash Oraon (32), a PLFI cadre, and arrested him from his residence in Ukdimadi Bardhakatoli under Torpa Police Station limits in Ranchi District. Police recovered a country-made revolver, a live bullet and PLFI pamphlets from him. 

On August 1, 2022, an ‘area commander’ of PLFI, identified as Badal Lohra, was arrested from the Tupudana area in Ranchi District. More than a dozen cases of attempted murder, robbery, and ‘levy’ extortion were registered against Lohra. He was mainly active in Basia in Simdega District, and Kamdara and Palkot in Gumla District. 

According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 38 PLFI cadres have been arrested since the beginning of the current year (data till August 21, 2022). During the corresponding period of 2021 as well, 38 PLFI cadres were arrested. Another 13 PLFI cadres were arrested in the remaining period of 2021, taking the total to 51 through 2021. Since the formation of the PLFI in July 2007, at least 714 PLFI cadres have been arrested. 

Mounting SF pressure has also resulted in the surrender of 32 PLFI cadres since July 2007, though not a single surrender has been reported in 2022. The last surrender was reported on March 11, 2018. 

Meanwhile, in the campaign against PLFI, Security Forces (SFs) have killed one PLFI cadre in the current year (data till August 21, 2022), as also during the corresponding period in 2021. In the remaining period of 2021, SFs killed another one cadre, taking the total to two, through 2021. A total of 102 PLFI cadres have been killed since the formation of the group in 2007. 

On the other hand, the last SF killing caried out by the PLFI took place on April 8, 2017, when a Sub-Inspector of Police and a constable were killed in a gunfight in Simdega District. Since its formation, PLFI has been responsible for seven SF fatalities. 

The last PLFI-linked civilian killing was reported on September 4, 2020, when PLFI cadres shot dead Nungu Barjo (30) at Khanda village under Bandgaon Police Station limits in the West Singhbhum District of Jharkhand. A total of 111 civilians have been killed by the PLFI, since its formation in 2007. 

Other parameters indicate that the outfit’s operational capacities in the State have suffered during the last few years due to SF successes on the ground. Indeed, no major incidents (resulting in three or more fatalities) involving the PLFI has been reported in 2022, as well as in 2021. The last such incident was on May 28, 2020, when three PLFI cadres, including a woman, were killed while another was injured in an exchange of fire with SFs in the Tabo Valley of the Manmandubera Forest under Tabo Police Station limits, in West Singhbhum District. Further, no incident of explosion has been carried out by the outfit in 2022, as, indeed, in the preceding five years. The last such incident was reported way back on October 16, 2016, when suspected PLFI cadres blew up two concrete sleepers on railway tracks by detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) between Khelari and McCluskieganj stations in Ranchi District.  

Though PLFI has been in a sustained decline over the past years, and has failed to carry out any major act of violence, its petty criminal and disruptive activities persist, as borne out by recent incidents.

According to an August 2022 report, PLFI is running a campaign for new recruitment, and is also forcing youth to join at gunpoint.

An August 6, 2022, report indicated that PLFI was giving arms to village youths to carry out the organisation’s subversive activities. This matter came to light during the interrogation of PLFI cadre Prakash Lakra, who was arrested by the Police on August 4, 2022. Prakash told the Police, inter alia, that PLFI had given a country-made revolvers, bullets and pamphlets to Bhikha Oraon in Lakra’s own village, and he was asked to expand the organization by involving other youth. 

Another report on May 21, 2022, revealed that PLFI cadres had issued a ‘decree’ in Namkum, Ranchi District, sending a letter to Rajan Tirkey, a young man, to give two AK 47 rifles or INR 2 million for the expansion of the organization. They threatened to kill him if he failed to meet the ‘levy’ demand. Tirkey, who lives in Rampur under the Namkum Police Station area, received the extortion demand through pamphlets and WhatsApp messages – which read “give extortion of 20 lakh rupees [INR 2 million]. If you cannot give money, then arrange 2 AK-47 rifles”. 

Further, a January 16, 2022, report, revealed that a Bangladeshi woman infiltrator identified as Anjali Patel aka Kaneez Fatima, who was arrested by Jharkhand Police in Delhi, was involved in supplying money and weapons to PLFI. According to an unnamed officer of the Ranchi Police, in Delhi Fatima met Nivesh Kumar, a Naxalite [Left Wing Extremist, LWE] who hails from Bihar and was living in Ranchi, and started working as a close associate with him, supplying arms to PLFI. An amount of INR 7.1 million and two expensive four-wheelers were seized from Fatima. 

PLFI is among the 19 LWE groups operating in Jharkhand, prominently including the CPI-Maoist, as well as other significant splinter groups of the CPI-Maoists including the Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), Jharkhand Jan Mukti Parishad (JJMP), Jharkhand Sangharsh Jan Mukti Morcha (JSJMM), and Jharkhand Prastuti Committee (JPC). PLFI is among the largest CPI-Maoist splinter groups in the state, but operates as more of an organized crime gang than an ‘ideologically driven’ movement. Its activities primarily focus on ‘levy’ (extortion) extraction.

 According to an August 18, 2022, report, SFs are preparing themselves for a decisive confrontation with PLFI, targeting the remaining militants in the group. Three years ago, there were 32 PLFI militants with rewards on their heads; their number is now down to just eight. These eight include PLFI ‘chief’ Dinesh Gope, with a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; ‘regional commander’ Martin Kerketta, INR 1.5 million; ‘zonal commanders’, Tilakeshwar Gope and Arif Ji aka Shashikant, INR 1 million each; ‘area commanders’, Balram Lohra aka Jatu aka Majnu, and Novel Sandi Purti, INR 200,000 each; two Local Guerilla Squad (LGS) members, Sukhram Gudiya aka Rode aka Gadwa and Samuel Budh aka Samu, INR 100,000 each.

PLFI has been considerably weakened, but remains a concern, particularly in view of its criminal activities, as well as its efforts to regain lost ground. Despite its decimation, as long as the remaining leadership element are able to evade the SFs, the group will continue to be a nuisance in the state.
